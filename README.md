# Kamlang-Forest-Cover-loss

Over the last few months I have spent time in understanding the impacts of climate change on multiple dimensions, the physical impacts of it, economics, analytics, and technologies for assesment.
To some effort i have tried to understand the impact of glacier loss ranging from Himalyan glaciers like Nanda Devi, Machoi to Antartica's fastest melting glaciers- Thwartes. Some of the analysis also includes the impat of rapid pace of urbanisation in cities like Bengaluru and Chennai on its biodiversity.

What's common in all this analysis?- 

The alarming rate at which we humans are disturbing the biodiversity around us. 
We get frustated every year with- How hot this year has been, rapid floods, increased frequency of storms if you live near the coastlines.

I remember Holi festival during my childhood, it still used to be winters those days but now heat waves start well before the festival.

We all know the impact of these, but little do we do as individuals (Left it on the governments and establishments!!) Climate change mitigation and adaptation starts from you!!

Below is the satellite image analysis using image processing to understand the loss of green cover of Kamlang Forest (Arunachal Pradesh)
With the increase in population, people have encroached the forest areas for shelter and agriculture, resulting in the loss of habitats for wildlife. Over the past few years there has been consistent effort from the government bodies to preserve this biodiversity.

Thsi analysis on the satellite images of Kamlang forest dating back to 1984 gives a glimpse of at what speed the forest has lost its green cover.
The percentage mentioned in the images is of the green cover in relation to the image dimensions.

The Forest has lost almost 40% of its green cover over the last 4 decades.
